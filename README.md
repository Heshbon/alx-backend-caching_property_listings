# ALX Backend Caching Property Listings

A Django-based property listing application demonstrating advanced caching strategies with Redis and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

This project implements a scalable property listing platform featuring multi-level caching, Docker containerization, and efficient database operations. The system showcases best practices for building high-performance Django applications with Redis caching integration.


## Features

* Multi-level caching implementation..
* PostgreSQL database with Docker containerization.
* Redis caching backend.
* Efficient cache invalidation strategies.
* Performance monitoring capabilities.
* Scalable architecture design.


## Technical Requirements

### Backend

* Python 3.12+
* Django 5.2.1+
* PostgreSQL 16.5+
* Redis 7.2.4+

### Development Tools

* Docker Engine.
* Docker Compose.
* pip.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. Docker Desktop installed.
2. Docker Compose available.
3. Python 3.12+ on your system.

4. Initialize database:
   ```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

## Implementation Details

### Cache Architecture

The application implements multiple caching layers:

1. View-Level Caching
   - URL-specific caching.
   - Time-based expiration.
   - Automatic cache invalidation.

2. QuerySet Caching
   - Database query optimization.
   - Shared across views.
   - Smart invalidation strategy.

3. Cache Invalidation.
   - Signal-based invalidation.
   - Model modification tracking.
   - Granular cache control.

### Performance Considerations

* Cache timeouts optimized for property listings.
* Efficient database indexing.
* Optimized query patterns.
* Memory usage monitoring.

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch:
   ```bash
git checkout -b feature/cache-optimization
```

2. Run migrations:
   ```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

3. Test locally:
   ```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest
```

4. Build production image:
   ```bash
docker build -t alx-backend-caching_property_listings .
```
